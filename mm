Build a futuristic 3D modern PS2 emulator website with a premium UI. The homepage should immediately show a large, glowing, neon blue “Download PS2 Emulator” button in the hero section, centered and impossible to miss. Background should include a subtle futuristic PlayStation-style visual such as holographic grids, PS2 controller shapes, or neon lines.

Below the hero, create multiple game category sections:
- Action
- Racing
- Sports
- Adventure
- RPG
- Fighting

Each category should be displayed as a modern 3D card grid or horizontal slider containing PS2 game cover images with:
- Game title
- Star rating
- Download button
- Details button

Clicking a game should open a detailed game page with:
- Large cover image
- Game description
- Screenshots gallery
- Requirements
- Controls info
- Download link

Design requirements:
- Dark PS2 theme with neon blue, purple, and PlayStation style accents
- Futuristic 3D UI elements with depth, shadows, glassmorphism, and soft glowing edges
- Smooth animations for hover, transitions, and sliders
- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Clean layout with perfect spacing and visual hierarchy

Technical requirements:
- Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Clean and organized file structure
- No external frontend frameworks unless necessary
- Performance optimized

Final result should look like a professional, premium gaming platform UI similar to PlayStation interfaces, with a visually impressive and modern user experience.
